 Built in python3, this project emulates the functioning of the AirBnB website.
 This version is called The Holberton B&B, and it is a project for [Holberton School Medellín](https://www.holbertonschool.com/co/campus_life/medellin).

 ## The Console
 There is a built-in command line interpreter (console) that provides a way to interact with the Storage-engine.
 
 Thru the console is possible to:

* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
